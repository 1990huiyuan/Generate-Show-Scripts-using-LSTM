So I know I should try smaller learnning first and then gradually increase hidden dimention. I decreased learning rate to 0.001 and it seems help but not too much. So I increased the hidden dimention to 256, 512. When it goes to 512 with 10 epochs, the loss satisfies to the requirement of under 3.5. For sequence lenght, I used 8 becuase it is close to the natural averaged line length. "
